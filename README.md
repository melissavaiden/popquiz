# How the game works!
At the bottom of the page, there are the current top 10 hits of the week. To play, drag and drop each of the bubbles into the corresponding green bubble. Once you've made all of your selections, hit the submit button and an alert will pop up letting you know how many you've gotten correct! The correct answers will turn green while the incorrect will turn red. From there, you can continue to rearrange all the songs and hit the submit button until you have all green bubbles. Good luck!
